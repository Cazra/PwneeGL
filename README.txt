PwneeGL is a Java-based game engine for Java using JOGL 2.*. 

All components of PwneeGL unless otherwise specified, have been developed and tested
on a 64-bit computer running Windows 7, but it should also be able to run on any computer 
with at least Java 6 properly installed. 

At this time, only the JOGL native jars for 64-bit Windows are included.

This framework is still largely a work in progress. So, I wouldn't recommend seriously using
it for any projects yet. I'm still working on implementing many features, and many already 
existing features could change. Really, I've just got it up on GitHub now so that I can work 
on it from home.



Requirements:
----------------
You'll need the following tools to be able to compile PwneeGL and run projects made with it:
* At least Java 6 JDK and JRE
* Adobe Ant
* A computer that can use OpenGL (your computer probably does, unless you're still living in 1995)
